Take a look around 
-------------------

- in [package.json](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/handlebars-setup-example?path=package.json:9:18) we added a reference to hbs
- in [server.js](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/handlebars-setup-example?path=server.js:10:0) we wired up handlebars to our node application
- also in [server.js](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/handlebars-setup-example?path=server.js:10:25) wired up `response.render()` in our main route
- in [index.hbs](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/handlebars-setup-example?path=views/index.hbs:19:32) we receive and render some data.
